# COVID-19-Forecasting
These are the notebooks from my blog post on TowardsDataScience (https://medium.com/@anaiysomalwar). This project focusses on the use of a Ridge Regression for the next-day prediction of American COVID-19 cases and deaths by using the past n days' data of cases and deaths as inputs to the model. However, through further research and experimentation, I have deveoped an improved model that can be used for 7-day prediction tasks with similar accuracy through recursion. Please refer to my preprint on medRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2020.08.13.20174631) for more information. Currently under review.
